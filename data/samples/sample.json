      "Historical note\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) was granted a charter by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on April 10, 1861. Classes started four years later in February 1865 and the Institute graduated its first students in 1868. Beginning in 1865 and continuing to the present, the Institute has published a formal course catalog.\nStudents admitted to MIT in its earliest years entered into a four-year program. The first two years they were required to take a set curriculum, but beginning the third year, they were to select one of six courses of study: Mechanical Engineering, Civil and Topographical Engineering, Practical Chemistry, Geology and Mining, Building and Architecture, or General Science and Literature.  At the end of the fourth year, upon successful completion of the chosen course of study, students were awarded a corresponding degree. The curriculum underwent many changes in the beginning years of the Institute and information about curriculum options and requirements was disseminated to students and faculty in the form of pamphlets and leaflets, in addition to the formal course catalog.\nDuring World War I, MIT undergraduates who were enrolled in the Student Army Training Corps were required to take the War Issues Course, a course in history and English under the direction of MIT English professor Frank Aydelotte."
